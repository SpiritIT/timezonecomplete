* Bugfix in Period#equals(): identical periods of 1 day would not be seen as equal; equal regular periods specified in different zones would not be seen as equal

## 5.4.0 (2016-11-07)

The tzdata module is not getting downloaded much and timezonecomplete is. This means that nobody understands that they have to install the tzdata manually. Therefore we make it automatic, assuming that for server use it doesn't matter to load all time zone data.

* Add the tzdata module as a proper dependency. For Node.JS applications, this will automatically add all time zones without initialisation. You can remove time zones by explicitly initializing the TzDatabase using TzDatabase.init().

## 5.3.0 (2016-11-07)

* Add DateTime#standardOffsetDuration() method that returns the offset excluding DST. (Issue #30)

## 5.1.1 (2016-10-27)

* Attempt to fix warnings about the 'require' function that webpack users experience due to automatic loading of tzdata NPM modules.
* Inline the sourcemaps as requested in issue #28

## 5.1.0 (2016-10-17)

* Simplify using timezonecomplete and tzdata with browserify
** Allow to pass arrays to TzDatabase.init()
** Describe way-of-work in README.md

## 5.0.1 (2016-10-17)

* Backward compatibility fix: make year/month/day/... parameters optional in TimeZone#abbreviationForUtc(), TimeZone#offsetForZone() and TimeZone#offsetForUtc()

## 5.0.0 (2016-10-16)

* Separate the tz data into a separate set of NPM modules, allowing to install only the time zones needed.

See [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) for instructions on how to migrate from earlier versions.

### 4.0.1 (2016-10-16)

* Fix for stand-alone use of timezonecomplete browser bundles
* Add stand-alone use example

### 4.0.0 (2016-10-15)

* Performance improvements, with a few minor breaking changes as a result

### 3.0.6 (2016-09-29)

* Upgrade TZ database to 2016g
* Upgrade dev-dependencies to latest versions

### 3.0.5 (2016-07-07)

* Upgrade TZ database to 2016f

### 3.0.4 (2016-06-15)

### 3.0.1 (2016-03-15)

* Upgrade TZ database to 2016b

### 3.0.0 (2016-03-14)

A small Period overhaul:
* Add Period#findLast() analogous to Period#findFirst().
* Periods are now symmetric around the start date, i.e. the start date is no longer considered the point only after which the periods run. So now, calling e.g. findPrev() on the start date returns one period before the start date rather than null.
** Period#findFirst() no longer returns the start date when called with a date multiple periods before the start date, but rather returns the first boundary date after the given date.
** Period#findPrev() no longer returns null when called with the start date or less, but rather returns the greatest boundary date before the given date.
** Period#start() is now deprecated in favor of Period#reference() - after all, the 'start' date is not a starting point anymore but a reference point only.
* The Period#equals() method now considers periods equal also if their reference dates (start dates) are not equal but are boundary dates of each other.

### 1.10.0 (2014-11-25)

* Added global functions for most static functions (the old ones will remain):
  * tc.now() for tc.DateTime.now()
  * tc.nowLocal() for tc.DateTime.nowLocal()
  * tc.nowUtc() for tc.DateTime.nowUtc()
  * tc.hours() for tc.Duration.hours()

* You can now choose whether timezonecomplete applies Daylight Saving Time for an IANA time zone: the tc.zone() and tc.TimeZone.zone() methods now accept an extra Boolean parameter that indicates whether DST should be applied. For backward compatibility the default value is true.

```
// old code (still works):
var d  = tc.Duration.seconds(20);
var dt = tc.DateTime.now();

// new code:
var d  = tc.seconds(20);
var dt = tc.now();

// Europe/Amsterdam time with DST
var dt = new DateTime(2014, 1, 1, 23, 59, 59, 999, tc.zone("Europe/Amsterdam"));

// Europe/Amsterdam time WITHOUT DST
var dt = new DateTime(2014, 1, 1, 23, 59, 59, 999, tc.zone("Europe/Amsterdam", false));
